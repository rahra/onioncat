* replace clock_gettime() by time(), no accuracy needed
* frame checking may be improved
* improve getopt() -- currently many things are hardcoded
* improve tun header test (check for src and dst ip)
* generally improve tun opening routine
* licence
* header compression
* fragment handler
* log levels and log output are currently somehow random
* interaction with OS routing table to be able to forward packets to "foreign" networks beside the TOR prefix
* peer list should be improved
//* IPv6 adresses are not checked for their validity
//* garbage collector for packet queue missing
//* garbage collector for session cleanup
//* packets received on sockets should be validated (Ethertype, ip)
//* socks_connector queue
//* packet_forwarder depends on socks_connector, currently possible unclean startup (not dangerous) -- socks connector now is multi-threaded and not blocking on a pipe, hence, this error _should_ (i'm currently not sure) not occur anymore.
