* version 
 - SOCKS destination IP configurable (v4 only)
 - disabled self connections to root nodes
 - fatal memory error in SOCKS queue fixed
 - bugfix in ether_ntoa_r()
 - variable for uptime implemented
 - routing is setup correctly on MACOSX with TUN dev
 - serious framesize bug with TAP device fixed
 - seems to run on Darwin yet ;)
 - consolidated header files
 - compiles on FreeBSD and OpenBSD
 - connecting logfile to /dev/null if background option given
 - staying in foreground if failed to open message logfile
 - bugfixes
 - IPv6 routes are aware of prefix lengths
 - IPv6 routing table can be manipulated through controller or config file
 - limited IPv6 routing capability
 - keepalive sent after connection setup (eases identification for remote
 ocat)
 - automatic initialization of default connections at startup
 - implemented TAP device and NDP protocol

* version 0.1.9
 - connect log => $HOME/.ocat/connect_log
 - IPv4 awareness

* version 0.1.8
 - port numbers changed to 8060 for local and virtual hidden service port
 - port number of controller interface changed to 8066
 - wrapped thread locking to internal functions
 - added HTTP check code if some one accidently connects using HTTP
 - replace clock_gettime() by gettimeofday() for portability reasons
 - compiles on FreeBSD again
 - replaced write() by send(). data should always be sent in total
   and never partially. tcp sendbuffer read-out code thereby removed.
 - added command fds to controller interface

* version 0.1.5 - 0.1.7
 - development versions only

* version 0.1.4 
 - acceptor and controller now use generic acceptor function
   which accepts locally on IPv4 and IPv6 localhost.  
 - socket connecter now multi-threaded (connect() blocks until connect) 
 - local controller socket available: commands: status, close, exit,
   quit - thread start routine modularized - logging improved

* verion 0.1.1 
 - improved interoperability 
 - compiles also under FreeBSD 6.1
 - TUN code slightly changed and more generic 
 - TUN header rewriting (BSD has different header from linux)

* version 0.1 
 - works good under linux, gcc-4.2, linux-2.6.22
