* version 0.2.1
 - released 2009/11/29, Bernhard R. Fischer

* version 0.2.0
 - version string improved
 - syslog messages contain name and PID
 - fixed some compiler warnings
 - updated hosts.onioncat
 - pid file creation optional
 - base development environment changed to OpenBSD 4.5
 - some type conversions fixed
 - fd 0,1,2 now reconnected to /dev/null

* version 0.1.13
 - released 2009/06/09, Bernhard R. Fischer

* version 0.1.12
 - compiles and runs successfully on 
 		Linux 2.6, MacOS X 10.5 (Intel), FreeBSD 6, OpenBSD 4.4
 - improved autoconf for better pthread configuration (acx_pthread.m4)
 - socks connector completely rewritten. Works now
   without dynamic thread pool. This is more memory efficient.
 - Windows branch merged into trunk
 - syslogging implemented
 - idle timeout increased to 3 mins
 - base32 en/decoding speed improved

* version 0.1.11
 - version tagged (this actually is 0.1.10-r472)
 - version cleanup -- new devel is now 0.1.12

* version 0.1.10
 - stdio is closed if process is backgrounded
 - If signalled twice (TERM, INT) it immediately exits
 - OnionCat daemonizes by default now
 - fragment buffer resynchronization enhanced
 - disabled connect log if unprivileged user -2 is used
 - getpwnam() replaced by getpwnam_r() because valgrind reported an error
   ...but unfortunatelly it still does
 - improved process termination handling
 - illegal mem access fixed in termination process
 - Socks connect exchanged by timed select
 - added signal handler for SIGTERM (and SIGHUP without implementation)
 - uid is changed to -2 if default user does not exist
 - fixed erroneous sockaddr size in socks connect (leaded to failure on
 OpenBSD)
 - improved tunnel name determination
 - fixed ifconfig for OpenBSD
 - fixed mem leak in thread creation process
 - replaced static local_listeners by configurable ones (for OC listen and
 controller listen)
 - graceful shutdown (CTRL-C or SIGINT)
 - thread stack size configurable (necessary because OpenBSD stacksize seems
 to be to small)

* version 0.1.9
 - man page updated
 - Local onion-URL may be generated randomly (option -R)
 - SOCKS destination IP configurable (v4 only)
 - disabled self connections to root nodes
 - fatal memory error in SOCKS queue fixed
 - bugfix in ether_ntoa_r()
 - variable for uptime implemented
 - routing is setup correctly on MACOSX with TUN dev
 - serious framesize bug with TAP device fixed
 - seems to run on Darwin yet ;)
 - consolidated header files
 - compiles on FreeBSD and OpenBSD
 - connecting logfile to /dev/null if background option given
 - staying in foreground if failed to open message logfile
 - bugfixes
 - IPv6 routes are aware of prefix lengths
 - IPv6 routing table can be manipulated through controller or config file
 - limited IPv6 routing capability
 - keepalive sent after connection setup (eases identification for remote
 ocat)
 - automatic initialization of default connections at startup
 - implemented TAP device and NDP protocol

* version 0.1.9
 - connect log => $HOME/.ocat/connect_log
 - IPv4 awareness

* version 0.1.8
 - port numbers changed to 8060 for local and virtual hidden service port
 - port number of controller interface changed to 8066
 - wrapped thread locking to internal functions
 - added HTTP check code if some one accidently connects using HTTP
 - replace clock_gettime() by gettimeofday() for portability reasons
 - compiles on FreeBSD again
 - replaced write() by send(). data should always be sent in total
   and never partially. tcp sendbuffer read-out code thereby removed.
 - added command fds to controller interface

* version 0.1.5 - 0.1.7
 - development versions only

* version 0.1.4 
 - acceptor and controller now use generic acceptor function
   which accepts locally on IPv4 and IPv6 localhost.  
 - socket connecter now multi-threaded (connect() blocks until connect) 
 - local controller socket available: commands: status, close, exit,
   quit - thread start routine modularized - logging improved

* verion 0.1.1 
 - improved interoperability 
 - compiles also under FreeBSD 6.1
 - TUN code slightly changed and more generic 
 - TUN header rewriting (BSD has different header from linux)

* version 0.1 
 - works good under linux, gcc-4.2, linux-2.6.22
