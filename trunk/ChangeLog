* 
 - replace clock_gettime() by gettimeofday() for portability reasons
 - compiles on FreeBSD again
 - replaced write() by send(). data should always be sent in total
   and never partially. tcp sendbuffer read-out code thereby removed.
 - added command fds to controller interface

* version 0.1.4 
 - acceptor and controller now use generic acceptor function
   which accepts locally on IPv4 and IPv6 localhost.  
 - socket connecter now multi-threaded (connect() blocks until connect) 
 - local controller socket available: commands: status, close, exit,
   quit - thread start routine modularized - logging improved

* verion 0.1.1 
 - improved interoperability 
 - compiles also und FreeBSD 6.1 i
 - TUN code slightly changed and more generic 
 - TUN header rewriting (BSD has different header from linux)

* version 0.1 
 - works good under linux, gcc-4.2, linux-2.6.22
