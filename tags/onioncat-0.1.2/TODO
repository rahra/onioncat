//* IPv6 adresses are not checked for their validity
* frame checking may be improved
//* garbage collector for packet queue missing
//* garbage collector for session cleanup
* improve getopt() -- currently many things are hardcoded
//* packets received on sockets should be validated (Ethertype, ip)
* improve tun header test (check for src and dst ip)
* generally improve tun opening routine
* licence
* socks_connector queue
* header compression
* fragment handler
* packet_forwarder depends on socks_connector, currently possible unclean startup (not dangerous)
